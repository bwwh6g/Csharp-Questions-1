Q: What is a namespace?<br />
A: Namespaces are used to organize classes.<br />
Q: What are value types?<br />
A: Value types are a value tied to a kind of type.<br />
Q: What are reference types?<br />
A: Reference types is a type that holds the memory location of a type instead of a value.<br />
Q: What is an automatic property and how is it useful?<br />
A: Automatic properties are ways to make property declaration easier and is useful because it doesn’t require any additional coding.<br />
Q: What is the purpose of using statement?<br />
A: Use statements are easy ways to use IDisposable objects.<br />
Q: What are dynamic type variables?<br />
A: Dynamic type variables are types that avoid compile type checking.<br />
Q: What is the purpose of the is operator?<br />
A: The is operator checks to see if a type of an object is compatible or not.<br />
Q: What are generics and how is using them useful?<br />
A: Generics are a class which is a placeholder for other classes and methods.<br />
Q: What is the scope of a public member of a class?<br />
A: The scope of a public member of a class can be accessed outside of its class.<br />
Q: Can you create a function that can accept a varying number of arguments?<br />
A: Yes.<br />
Q: How do you sort an array?<br />
A: There are multiple ways to sort an array but the easiest and most convenient is using the Sort() method.<br />
Q: What is a nullable type and what purpose does it serve?<br />
A: A nullable type allows for value types to have a value null. It is used when a type does not have a value.<br />
Q: What is an enumeration?<br />
A: Enumerations are a set of integer constants.<br />
Q: What is inheritance?<br />
A: Inheritance is a way for other classes to use function ability from other classes.<br />
Q: Is multiple inheritance supported?<br />
A: No.<br />
Q: What is the purpose of as operator<br />
A: As operator performs certain conversions for reference and nullable types.<br />
Q: What is an object?<br />
A: An object supports all classes and types.<br />
Q: What is the difference between a struct and a class?<br />
A: A struct is a value type while a class consist of reference types.<br />
Q: What is the difference between continue and break statements?<br />
A: Continue skips the rest of the current iteration while a break breaks a loop.<br />
Q: What is this and how is it used?<br />
A: This refers to the current instance of a class and is used as a modifier.<br />
Q: What is try and catch and when are they used?<br />
A: Try and catch is a way to deal with errors. They are used when an error happens in the try block.<br />
Q: How is exception handling done?<br />
A: Exception handling by checking if a statement is correct or not.<br />
Q: What is finally and what is its purpose?<br />
A: Finally, is a part of a try catch block and is used to execute statements always.<br />
Q: List the differences between Array and ArrayList.<br />
A: Arrays are a set of strong typed collections with a fixed length while an ArrayList is not strong typed with a dynamic collection. <br />
Q: Define constructor.<br />
A: Constructors are a way for a programmer to write code.<br />
Q: When can var be used to declare a variable and how is the type for the variable determined?<br />
A: Var can be used to declare a variable when not given an explicit type and the type for the variable is determined by the type.<br />
Q: What is an abstract class?<br />
A: Abstract classes are used to show function ability without giving up the internal details.<br />
Q: What is an interface?<br />
A: An interface is an abstract class with abstract members only.<br />
Q: What is a method?<br />
A: A method is a code block with a series of statements.<br />
Q: What is a property?<br />
A: A property allows to read or write a value to a field.<br />
Q: What is an access specifier?<br />
A: Access specifier is way to separate what gets access to certain properties and what doesn’t.<br />
Q: What access specifiers are supported and what do they mean?<br />
A: Private: Limits accessibility to the class. Public: Has no limits. Internal: Access within assembly. Protected: Accessible when inheritance is involved. Protected Internal: Access within assembly and through inheritance.<br />
Q: What is a collection?<br />
A: A collection is a flexible way to work with groups of objects.<br />
Q: What is a Hash Table?<br />
A: Hash Tables are a collection of key and value pairs.<br />
