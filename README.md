Q: What is a namespace?
A: Namespaces are used to organize classes.
Q: What are value types?
A: Value types are a value tied to a kind of type.
Q: What are reference types?
A: Reference types is a type that holds the memory location of a type instead of a value.
Q: What is an automatic property and how is it useful?
A: Automatic properties are ways to make property declaration easier and is useful because it doesn’t require any additional coding.
Q: What is the purpose of using statement?
A: Use statements are easy ways to use IDisposable objects.
Q: What are dynamic type variables?
A: Dynamic type variables are types that avoid compile type checking.
Q: What is the purpose of the is operator?
A: The is operator checks to see if a type of an object is compatible or not.
Q: What are generics and how is using them useful?
A: Generics are a class which is a placeholder for other classes and methods.
Q: What is the scope of a public member of a class?
A: The scope of a public member of a class can be accessed outside of its class.
Q: Can you create a function that can accept a varying number of arguments?
A: Yes.
Q: How do you sort an array?
A: There are multiple ways to sort an array but the easiest and most convenient is using the Sort() method.
Q: What is a nullable type and what purpose does it serve?
A: A nullable type allows for value types to have a value null. It is used when a type does not have a value.
Q: What is an enumeration?
A: Enumerations are a set of integer constants.
Q: What is inheritance?
A: Inheritance is a way for other classes to use function ability from other classes.
Q: Is multiple inheritance supported?
A: No.
Q: What is the purpose of as operator
A: As operator performs certain conversions for reference and nullable types.
Q: What is an object?
A: An object supports all classes and types.
Q: What is the difference between a struct and a class?
A: A struct is a value type while a class consist of reference types.
Q: What is the difference between continue and break statements?
A: Continue skips the rest of the current iteration while a break breaks a loop.
Q: What is this and how is it used?
A: This refers to the current instance of a class and is used as a modifier.
Q: What is try and catch and when are they used?
A: Try and catch is a way to deal with errors. They are used when an error happens in the try block.
Q: How is exception handling done?
A: Exception handling by checking if a statement is correct or not.
Q: What is finally and what is its purpose?
A: Finally, is a part of a try catch block and is used to execute statements always.
Q: List the differences between Array and ArrayList.
A: Arrays are a set of strong typed collections with a fixed length while an ArrayList is not strong typed with a dynamic collection. 
Q: Define constructor.
A: Constructors are a way for a programmer to write code.
Q: When can var be used to declare a variable and how is the type for the variable determined?
A: Var can be used to declare a variable when not given an explicit type and the type for the variable is determined by the type.
Q: What is an abstract class?
A: Abstract classes are used to show function ability without giving up the internal details.
Q: What is an interface?
A: An interface is an abstract class with abstract members only.
Q: What is a method?
A: A method is a code block with a series of statements.
Q: What is a property?
A: A property allows to read or write a value to a field.
Q: What is an access specifier?
A: Access specifier is way to separate what gets access to certain properties and what doesn’t.
Q: What access specifiers are supported and what do they mean?
A: Private: Limits accessibility to the class. Public: Has no limits. Internal: Access within assembly. Protected: Accessible when inheritance is involved. Protected Internal: Access within assembly and through inheritance.
Q: What is a collection?
A: A collection is a flexible way to work with groups of objects.
Q: What is a Hash Table?
A: Hash Tables are a collection of key and value pairs.
